# Wakanda
Wakanda is a fictional place, but that doesn't mean it's not an awesome place.
Hi I'm Melvin and since 2009, I have travelled as a military spouse 
with my family from the east coast to the west of the US.
What does that have to do with Wakanda? 
Well everything really, it's an awesome fact 
about me that's as awesome as I think Wakanda is.
